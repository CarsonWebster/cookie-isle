## Our Story

The Cookie Isle started in a tiny home kitchen with a big dream: to bring the joy of fresh-baked cookies to our community. What began as batches for friends and family quickly grew into something more—a micro-bakery built on love, quality ingredients, and recipes perfected over generations.

## Our Philosophy

We believe cookies should be more than just a snack. They're a moment of comfort, a sweet surprise in your day, and a way to show someone you care. That's why we:

- **Bake fresh daily** – No day-old cookies here
- **Use real ingredients** – Real butter, pure vanilla, premium chocolate
- **Make everything by hand** – Each cookie is crafted with care
- **Keep it small** – Quality over quantity, always

## Meet the Baker

Hi, I'm the heart and hands behind The Cookie Isle. Baking has been my passion since I was tall enough to reach the counter (with a little help from a step stool). After years of perfecting recipes and sharing cookies with everyone who walked through my door, I decided to turn that passion into something more.

Every cookie that leaves our kitchen carries a piece of that original joy—the simple happiness of pulling a warm tray from the oven and sharing it with someone special.
