Our Salted Caramel Bliss cookie is a perfect harmony of sweet and savory. Rich, buttery caramel is swirled throughout the dough and topped with flaky Maldon sea salt that adds just the right crunch.

Each cookie is finished with a drizzle of house-made caramel sauce and a final sprinkle of salt crystals. This cookie pairs beautifully with a hot cup of coffee or a cold glass of milk.

**Best enjoyed:** Slightly warmed to let the caramel get extra gooey.
